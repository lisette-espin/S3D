## C++ code for fast implementation of the Structured Sum of Squares Decomposition (S3D) algorithm

### Installation

Download folder, then run the commands 
```
$ make train
$ make predict
```
from the terminal/command-line (in the folder directory) to create the excecutable files `train` and `predict`. `train` takes as input a .csv file and trains an S3D model on the data, while `predict` uses the model to make predictions. 

### Inputs and Outputs

Details of both the required and optional inputs to `train` and `predict` are found in the headers of the train.cpp and predict_expectations.cpp files respectively.

### Examples

An example for implementation is given by the scripts `example_script_train.sh` and `example_script_predict.sh`
